/* Depreciated, kept until further notice */

/* These are the changes that EckerDecker had proposed. These changes came
   from an idea of mine to make the vote icons transition with the bottom
   of the vote buttons. Try it out for a bit; If you do not like these
   changes, then you can revert back to the way things were before by
   changing which sheet to import in the master style.

   Notify when a decision has been made so some or all of this code
   can be reintegrated into the master sheet.

/* Colours */
  /* > For background colour and text. Anything meant to be 0% opaque
       should instead be shoved into the bottom of the document under
       the "Disappear" section.
